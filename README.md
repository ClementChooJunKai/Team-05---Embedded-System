# Team-05---Embedded-System

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a project aimed at creating an intelligent autonomous 2-wheel robot car. The project utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, various sensors, and a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to achieve efficient navigation, obstacle avoidance, and barcode recognition.

Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robot car capable of navigating a predefined track, efficiently avoiding obstacles, and recognizing barcodes using infrared sensors. The integration of a PID controller enhances the car's control system, ensuring smooth and accurate motion during navigation and barcode scanning.
